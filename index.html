              Imagine it's the early 2000s. You've got chunky highlights in your hair (zig-zag
              parting, of course), baggy jeans on, and a fresh Nokia 3310 in your hand. This little
              brick of joy is not just any phone—it's
              <em>the</em> phone that everyone at school is talking about...

              <p>
                With its compact, sturdy build, this phone was basically invincible. You could drop
                it, throw it, or accidentally sit on it, and it would still be ready to go, like a
                loyal sidekick that never let you down.

                The real star? <strong>Snake II</strong>. This game was pure magic, turning every
                spare moment into a high-stakes challenge to beat your own record. If you were the
                Snake champ, you were basically a school legend.

            <div class="card-body">
              <p>
                And who could forget the customizable ringtones? With the Nokia 3310, you could
                compose your own tunes, making your phone <em>truly</em> yours. Whether it was
                Beethoven or Britney, your ringtone was your personal anthem.

              <p>
                And while your friends with their fancy new gadgets were always hunting for a
                charger, you were chilling. The 3310 had the battery life of a champion, lasting for
                days on end. It was like the Energizer Bunny of phones—it just kept going and going.
                This meant you could text all day, play Snake, and still have enough juice to make a
                call in an emergency.

              <p>
                Texting on the Nokia 3310 was its own kind of art. With the T9 predictive text, you
                had to learn the language of the keys. But once you got the hang of it, you could
                fire off messages faster than you could speak. It was all about efficiency and
                style, with texts that were short, sweet, and to the point. Plus, with the
                459-character limit, you could write mini-novels if you wanted to—unheard of at the
                time.

                Finally, let’s not forget the swappable faceplates. Your phone could change colors
                and styles as easily as your mood. Whether you were feeling neon green one day or
                electric blue the next, the 3310 let you express yourself in every way possible.

              The Nokia 3310 wasn’t just a phone; it was your pocket-sized partner in crime. It was
              your gaming console, your music composer, and your social connector, all wrapped up in
              a virtually indestructible package. For a generation of teenagers, the 3310 was more
              than just a piece of tech—it was a lifestyle.
