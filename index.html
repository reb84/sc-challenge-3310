            <p>
              Imagine it's the early 2000s. You've got chunky highlights in your hair (zig-zag
              parting, of course), baggy jeans on, and a fresh Nokia 3310 in your hand. This little
              brick of joy is not just any phone — it's <em>the</em> phone that everyone at school
              is talking about...
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-items">
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              With its compact, sturdy build, this phone was basically invincible. You could drop
              it, throw it, or accidentally sit on it, and it would still be ready to go, like a
              loyal sidekick that never let you down.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-items">
            <h3>Snake II</h3>
            <p>
              The real star? <strong>Snake II</strong>. This game was pure magic, turning every
              spare moment into a high-stakes challenge to beat your own record. If you were the
              Snake champ, you were basically a school legend.

          <div class="flex-items">
            <h3>Custome Ringtones</h3>
            <p>
              And who could forget the customizable ringtones? With the Nokia 3310, you could
              compose your own tunes, making your phone <em>truly</em> yours. Whether it was
              Beethoven or Britney, your ringtone was your personal anthem.
            </p>

            <h3>Battery Life</h3>
            <p>
              The 3310 had the battery life of a champion, lasting for days on end. It was like the
              Energizer Bunny of phones—it just kept going and going. This meant you could text all
              day, play Snake, and still have enough juice to make a call in an emergency.

          <div class="flex-items">
            <h3>T9 Texting</h3>
            <p>
              Texting on the Nokia 3310 was its own kind of art. With the T9 predictive text, you
              had to learn the language of the keys. But once you got the hang of it, you could fire
              off messages faster than you could speak. Plus, a 459-character limit? Unheard of at
              the time.
            </p>

          <div class="flex-items">
            <h3>Swappable Faceplates</h3>
            <p>
              Finally, let's not forget the swappable faceplates. Your phone could change colors and
              styles as easily as your mood. Whether you were feeling neon green one day or electric
              blue the next, the 3310 let you express yourself in every way possible.

              The Nokia 3310 wasn’t just a phone; it was your pocket-sized partner in crime. It was
              your gaming console, your music composer, and your social connector, all wrapped up in
              a virtually indestructible package. For a generation of teenagers, the 3310 was more
              than just a piece of tech—it was a lifestyle.
